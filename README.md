const aboutMe = {

  greeting: `üëãüèΩ Hi there! My name is Shubham (pronounced Shoob-hum) and thanks for visiting my GitHub page.`,
  
  about: `üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª I am a Computer Science graduate and IT professional who has dedicated the last few years to building
  a career in Software Quality and Testing. Outside of what I focus on in my career, I also have passions for
  automation, scripting, and cybersecurity. If you'd like to learn more about my professional impact within the
  Software Quality domain specifically, please check out my LinkedIn.`,
  
  work: `ü§ñ I'm a big proponent of using automation and scripting to maximise productivity and improve the
  efficiency of my workflow. I leverage these skills to streamline repetitive tasks, both complex and mundane.
  Whether it's a CLI script to fill payroll hours or a comprehensive Cypress framework to test an app used by
  100,000+ users, it will be automated. While my automation work tackles daily needs and other requirements,
  I polish scripts and code before sharing on GitHub by improving capabilities, documentation, and structure.
  That way you get more to work with and can better contribute to my projects.`,
  
  interests: `üíª In addition to my expertise in Software Quality and Automation, like I mentioned before I also
  have a passion for Cybersecurity. I majored in Cybersecurity for my Computer Science degree and am an avid
  InfoSec and OpSec enthusiast. I am committed to continuously expanding my knowledge through ongoing study
  and plan to pursue relevant certifications. I have developed multiple open-source Cybersecurity-related projects
  such as a password generator, password strength checker and a comprehensive all-in-one script that employs
  multiple types of penetration tests onto a target website. I'm excited to work on more projects and build more
  tools such as a MAC address changer, network scanner, ARP/DNS spoofer, packet sniffer and more.`,
  
  conclusion: `ü§ù If you've made it this far, hopefully this has given you a proper (and not too long) overview of
  my skills and interests. Please feel free to explore my GitHub repositories and profile to learn more about my 
  projects. I welcome any collaborators who want to get involved. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any 
  questions or just want to connect and exchange ideas. Let's build solutions that allow us to get work done
  faster and breathe a little more.`,
  
  contact: `üì´ You can reach me through email, LinkedIn or even here, in the discussion sections of my repos.`
