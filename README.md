👋🏽 Hi there! My name is Shubham (pronounced Shoob-hum) and thanks for visiting my GitHub page. 

👨🏽‍💻 I am a Computer Science graduate and IT professional who has dedicated the last few years to building a career in Software Quality and Testing. Outside of what I focus on in my career, I also have passions for automation, scripting, and cybersecurity. If you'd like to learn more about my professional impact within the Software Quality domain specifically, please check out [my LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharma-it/) 

🤖 I'm a big proponent of using automation and scripting to maximise productivity. I leverage these skills to streamline repetitive tasks, both complex and mundane. Whether it's a CLI script to fill payroll hours or a comprehensive Cypress framework to test an app used by 100,000+ users, I'll automate it! While my automation work tackles daily needs, I polish scripts before sharing on GitHub by improving capabilities, documentation, and structure. So, you all get more to work with and can better contribute to my projects. ####

💻 In addition to my expertise in Software Quality and Automation, like I mentioned before I also have a passion for Cybersecurity. I majored in Cyber Security for my Computer Science degree and am an avid InfoSec and OpSec enthusiast. I am committed to continuously expanding my cybersecurity knowledge through ongoing study and plan to pursue relevant certifications. I'm also working on an open-source project to develop a suite of CLI-based penetration testing and security tools compatible with Windows and Linux. The current iteration features a password generator, but I'm excited to expand its capabilities soon to include a wider range of tools like a MAC address changer, network scanner, ARP/DNS spoofer, packet sniffer and more. Independent of this specific project, I have also developed a comprehensive all-in-one script that employs multiple types of penetration tests onto a target website. 

🫱🏽‍🫲🏻 If you've made it this far, hopefully this has given you a quick overview of my skills and interests. Please feel free to explore my GitHub repositories and profile to learn more about my projects. I welcome any collaborators who want to get involved. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to connect and exchange ideas. Let's build solutions that allow us to breathe a little more.
