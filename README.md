const aboutMe = {

  greeting: `üëãüèΩ Hi there! My name is Shubham (pronounced Shoob-hum) and thanks for visiting my GitHub page.`,
  
  about: `üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª I am a Computer Science graduate and IT professional who has dedicated the last few years to building
  a career in Software Quality and Testing. I have passions for software quality, automation, testing, accessibility,
  performance, UI/UX, CI/CD, BDD, FOSS, Agile, IaC, DevOps, LLMs, scripting and cybersecurity. If you'd like to learn
  about the professional impact I have made in the Software Quality domain, please check out my LinkedIn profile.`,
  
  work: `ü§ñ I'm a big proponent of using automation and scripting to maximise productivity and improve the
  efficiency of one's workflow. I leverage these skills to streamline repetitive tasks, both simple and complex.
  Whether it's to fill in payroll hours or to automate the testing of an appication used by more than 1,000,000 users,
  it will be automated (i.e. using a CLI script for the former, and a Cypress-based framework for the latter).`,
  
  interests: `üíª My next most significant IT-related passion besides Software Quality and Automation, lies in the field
  of cybersecurity. I majored in cybersecurity for my Computer Science degree and am an avid InfoSec and OpSec enthusiast.
  I have developed multiple FOSS cybersecurity-related projects such as a password generator, password strength
  checker and an all-in-one script that employs multiple types of penetration tests onto a target website. I'm
  excited to build more tools such as a MAC address changer, network scanner, ARP/DNS spoofer, packet sniffer and more.`,
  
  conclusion: `ü§ù I really appreciate it if you've made it this far, hopefully I've given you a proper and not too long
  of an overview of my skills and interests. Please feel free to explore my GitHub repositories and profile to learn
  more about my projects. I welcome any collaborators who want to get involved. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have
  any questions or just want to connect and exchange ideas. Let's continue to build solutions that expedite our
  workflows and provide us with some more room to breathe in our already busy lives.`,
  
  contact: `üì´ You can reach me through email, LinkedIn or even here, in the discussion sections of my repositories.`
